Dropbox-Activity-Logger
=======================

Logs all activity within a Dropbox folder to an RDBMS store, and then does impressive stuff with the data.

This (soon to be) awesome app will be one component in a larger app i'm gonna call **Invoicer**, which goes through various logs, trying to figure out when you worked on what.

Any file activity whatsoever that is performed in this directory will be logged with a timestamp. This is useful for self-auditing purposes, and was created to aid in creating invoices.
